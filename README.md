#The log of my 100 Days Of Code

#day 1 02.01.2017
Started to create little text game with Python 2 (reading "Learn Python The Hard Way").
Set up classes and sceanrio for the game.

#day 2 03.01.2017
File attached!
Finished my text game. I will add few styling lines, but every other thing is okay.
I will try to add comments for every line or most of them, just for myself. Reason - to know in the future what I meant with every line! 

#day 3 04.01.2017
Yesterday, before i was going to sleep i thought try something with Python Tkinter. So i started to build this program.
It will run threw path (example: C:\) and find all the files which ands with specific extension (.txt, .png, etc) and copy all file yo new folder.
Script is ready for this main function. As I am new to Tkinter module, I will check that deeper. All i have to do is to create user friendly GUI.
