#The log of my 100 Days Of Code

#day 1 02.01.2017
Started to create little text game with Python 2 (reading "Learn Python The Hard Way").
Set up classes and sceanrio for the game.

#day 2 03.01.2017
File attached!
Finished my text game. I will add few styling lines, but every other thing is okay.
I will try to add comments for every line or most of them, just for myself. Reason - to know in the future what I meant with every line! 

#day 3 04.01.2017
Yesterday, before i was going to sleep i thought try something with Python Tkinter. So i started to build this program.
It will run threw path (example: C:\) and find all the files which ands with specific extension (.txt, .png, etc) and copy all files to new folder.
Script is ready for this main function. As I am new to Tkinter module, I will check that deeper. All i have to do is to create user friendly GUI. I hope it will not be very hard!!!

Okay, that is pretty hard! I have problems to figure out how to place buttons, fields for user input with Frame.
I will try to figure this out tomorrow.

#day 4 05.01.2017

I was wondering if there are something like padding, margin or border like in CSS in Python Tkinter and guess what - there is. :D
So now every widget is in the right places. Now i need to figure out, how to get user to enter neccesery paths. On CMD it is working great.

#day 5 09.01.2017
Few days I havent done anything. But today I finally figured our Tkinter Entry widget. Now my program is working properly (code attached). I will try to make it look better, but everything else is working fine. One thing is bothering me. I have used stackoverflow help two times (creating my own ticket with my own code), because I just couldnt saw the mistake. But those mistakes was so simple, that I cant even understand how I did no saw that(and I have 4 eyes). Last one was that i called two variables equal. How i did not saw that? Deam...but everything is working and thats all that metter. 

#day 6 10.01.20166
I have added few changes, error message and colors. My first real program is ready. WUUHUUUU! Code is updated.
As i have finished my text game and my first program, I will continue reading with "Learn Python The Hardway" book.
