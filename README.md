#The log of my 100 Days Of Code

#day 1 02.01.2017
Started to create little text game with Python 2 (reading "Learn Python The Hard Way").
Set up classes and sceanrio for the game.

#day 2 03.01.2017
Finished my text game. I will add few styling lines, but every other thing is okay.
I will try to add comments for every line or most of them, just for myself. Reason - to know in the future what I meant with every line!
