# The log of my 100 Days Of Code

# day 1 02.01.2017
Started to create little text game with Python 2 (reading "Learn Python The Hard Way").
Set up classes and sceanrio for the game.

# day 2 03.01.2017
File attached!
Finished my text game. I will add few styling lines, but every other thing is okay.
I will try to add comments for every line or most of them, just for myself. Reason - to know in the future what I meant with every line! 

# day 3 04.01.2017
Yesterday, before i was going to sleep i thought try something with Python Tkinter. So i started to build this program.
It will run threw path (example: C:\) and find all the files which ands with specific extension (.txt, .png, etc) and copy all files to new folder.
Script is ready for this main function. As I am new to Tkinter module, I will check that deeper. All i have to do is to create user friendly GUI. I hope it will not be very hard!!!

Okay, that is pretty hard! I have problems to figure out how to place buttons, fields for user input with Frame.
I will try to figure this out tomorrow.

# day 4 05.01.2017

I was wondering if there are something like padding, margin or border like in CSS in Python Tkinter and guess what - there is. :D
So now every widget is in the right places. Now i need to figure out, how to get user to enter neccesery paths. On CMD it is working great.

# day 5 09.01.2017
Few days I havent done anything. But today I finally figured our Tkinter Entry widget. Now my program is working properly (code attached). I will try to make it look better, but everything else is working fine. One thing is bothering me. I have used stackoverflow help two times (creating my own ticket with my own code), because I just couldnt saw the mistake. But those mistakes was so simple, that I cant even understand how I did no saw that(and I have 4 eyes). Last one was that i called two variables equal. How i did not saw that? Deam...but everything is working and thats all that metter. 

# day 6 10.01.2017
I have added few changes, error message and colors. My first real program is ready. WUUHUUUU! Code is updated.
As i have finished my text game and my first program, I will continue reading with "Learn Python The Hardway" book.

# day 7 12.01.2017
So I am closer to the end of the book. Now I will try to combine Python with HTML/CSS. I have decide to learn JavaScript, but before that I have to end with "Learn Python the Hard way" book. The ending is pretty booring, but when my Python text game will work on web, I will need to creat webpage. As I know few things from HTML and CSS, Javascript will be perfect choice for me.

# day 8 20.01.2017
I havent shown up in here because I couldnt figure out, what should i do next. So I decided to start with....website :) I will try to build my first webpage. I know little bit of HTML and CSS, so this will work for me. My new goal for my self - JavaScript. After reading some coments, i should check another language which is diffrent from Python. Most suggestions was JavaScript for Web Development. So yeah, wish me luck. Today i have created like a cover for my page (also navigation bar(found cool uderline hover code) and introduction text).


# day 9 07.11.2017
I dont know why I didnt continue with this but I am back. I am reading Jon Duckett book about a month and its been great so far. So in temp_1 folder you can find my first tamplate which I created. Today Im reading HTML5 LAYOUT (thats why I didnt use those tags in my first tamplate).

# day 10 08.11.2017
I have finished HTML/CSS chapters from this awesome book. Still struggle around flow, clear and overflow, but I will get there. I will take my final notes and then I will try to recreate easy tamplate. But at first, I need to find one....

# day 11 11.11.2017
 Fighting with third tamplate today. Trying to get more around float and everything. Few things still have to look up, but hey...you cant remeber everything.
 
# day 12 12.11.2017
I think I have figured out float (also positions). I updated tamplate with some colors, shadows, box-radiuss and I think it looks okay. I will try to add soc. icons with hovers tomorrow.

# day 13 13.11.2017
Finished my 3rd tamplate. There are some issues (hovers, fonts), but I wanted to get more around positioning and float, so I guess I know the basics of those now. Not sure what to do next, but I think I will find 4th tamplate to recreate and after that I will continue with books.

# day 13_2 13.11.2017
So I started my 4th tamplate. Finally used positions in real life and before finishing tamplates structure I realized that I need to creat individual container for left side and for right side, so every text on the right side is centered properly. Well, I will try to do that tomaroow. But in general, very productive day.

# day 14 14.11.2017
Finished my 4th tmplate. Less colors, more getting around with icons and position. One thing is bothering me about footer after float, but I will check that deeper. I have only two chapters left in HTML/CSS book and I hope I will finish at least one one of those tomorrow. Also, I got Adobe Ilustrator on my Linux Ubuntu. I will try to design flat potrait of my self for my portfolio page, but that is for the future.

# day 15 16.11.2017
Didnt do nothing yesterday and I feel pretty bad about my self. So I finished Jon Duckett HTML/CSS book and now Im reading Jon Duckett JavaScript/jQuery book. Its only begining and I think few next week I will concentrate only on this book. Still everyday I will write down my progress on the book here.

# day 16 17.11.2017
Finished 1/b chapter "How do computers fit in with the world around them". Excellent explenations with hotel and cars as object examples. Putting down some notes really helps. Cant wait to go further.

# day 17 18.11.2017
Finished 1/c chapter "How do I write a script for a webpage". Also, working little bit around Terminal basics.

# day 18 19.11.2017
Finished chapter 2. Basic JavaScript instructions. Created my first JS script, wuhuuu. I misspelled "length" and I thought, this cant brake me, so, I found that "bug". Also, I didnt download offered scripts for the book and I created my own CSS styling. Nothing much, but still using my HTML/CSS skills which I learned from previous book.

# day 19 20.11.2017
Started chapter 3. Functions, methods and objects. Getting around functions (something similar with Python). I understand standart functions, but I hope that book will go deeper on anonymous functions and function expressions. Also, I got email, that I am accepted to the Chingu's Winter Voyage session. Cant wait to start! :)

# day 21 23.11.2017
Learning Git/Github from @RainbowCoder tutorials. At the moment Github branches.

# day 22 24.11.2017
Runing threw Github Fork, Pull request and Issues.

# day 23 27.11.2017
This is my first line in file threw terminal with git :) I finished The Coding Train tutorials on GIT/Github. I think I know the basics now and I can`t wait to work on real projects with others on git/GitHub (waiting email to Voyage 3 session).

# day 24 28.11.2017
I came back to Jon Duckets JavaScript book. Still on chapter 3. Functions, methods and objects, but I taking notes down very serously and I realy try to understand the concept of every page. Also, I been added to Chingu Voyage session Slack channel. Lot`s of info, new stuff and new peoples, but everything is great for now :)

# day 25 29.11.2017
Still on chapter 3. Decided to recreate examples with HTML/CSS also, because, as we all know, practical learning is always better.
On Chingus #slack channel another Latvian reached me. It`s awesome to know that I am not alone :D

# day 1 02.01.2018
I will start this challange third time from begining. Lot`s of holidays between previous one and I am pretty mad at myself. I will continue where I left - Jon Duckett Javascript book. Ofcourse, I read something about web development every day, but I think, the real learning begins with my laptop and notebook open. Today I did some freecodecamp challanges and some examples from this amaizing Javascript book about objects. Wish me luck :D  

# day 2 03.01.2018
Now I know what DOM means. Going further with javascript - keyword "this", arrays are objects, built-in objects!

# day 3 04.01.2018
40 minutes is still more then nothing. Before soocer game I did few examples with window and document object. I hope I will be able to do more tomorrow.

# day 4 09.01.2018
Wrote down some notes and did some examples with String, Number and Math properties and methods. Tommorrow I hope I will finish 3rd chapter.

# day 5 10.01.2018
Date object is something, that would be pretty usefull long time ago. Almost done with last excercise od 3rd chapter.

# day 6 11.01.2018
I understand why I should do that and what it means, but still I think that I never will come up with stuff like those JavaScript examples. I hope it will come to me :)
 Diging deeper in JavaScript practical examples.

# day 7 12.01.2018
I finally get over chapter 3 in Johns Duckets Javascript book.

# day 8 15.01.2018
Chapter 4. Decisions and loops! Let's start!

# day 9 16.01.2018
AND, OR, NOT, IF, ELSE..IF. I was very good with these when I was studying Python. Now I know how to use them with JavaScript.

# day 10 17.01.2018
Today I learnd things like SWITCH, TYPE COERCION, WEAK TYPING, TRUTHY and FALSY values, SHORT CIRCUIT values. Also, did few challanges on freecodecamp.

# day 11 22.01.2018
LOOPS! FOR, WHILE, DO..WHILE. So far, so good!

# day 12 23.01.2018
