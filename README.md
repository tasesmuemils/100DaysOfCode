# The log of my 100 Days Of Code

# day 1 02.01.2017
Started to create little text game with Python 2 (reading "Learn Python The Hard Way").
Set up classes and sceanrio for the game.

# day 2 03.01.2017
File attached!
Finished my text game. I will add few styling lines, but every other thing is okay.
I will try to add comments for every line or most of them, just for myself. Reason - to know in the future what I meant with every line! 

# day 3 04.01.2017
Yesterday, before i was going to sleep i thought try something with Python Tkinter. So i started to build this program.
It will run threw path (example: C:\) and find all the files which ands with specific extension (.txt, .png, etc) and copy all files to new folder.
Script is ready for this main function. As I am new to Tkinter module, I will check that deeper. All i have to do is to create user friendly GUI. I hope it will not be very hard!!!

Okay, that is pretty hard! I have problems to figure out how to place buttons, fields for user input with Frame.
I will try to figure this out tomorrow.

# day 4 05.01.2017

I was wondering if there are something like padding, margin or border like in CSS in Python Tkinter and guess what - there is. :D
So now every widget is in the right places. Now i need to figure out, how to get user to enter neccesery paths. On CMD it is working great.

# day 5 09.01.2017
Few days I havent done anything. But today I finally figured our Tkinter Entry widget. Now my program is working properly (code attached). I will try to make it look better, but everything else is working fine. One thing is bothering me. I have used stackoverflow help two times (creating my own ticket with my own code), because I just couldnt saw the mistake. But those mistakes was so simple, that I cant even understand how I did no saw that(and I have 4 eyes). Last one was that i called two variables equal. How i did not saw that? Deam...but everything is working and thats all that metter. 

# day 6 10.01.2017
I have added few changes, error message and colors. My first real program is ready. WUUHUUUU! Code is updated.
As i have finished my text game and my first program, I will continue reading with "Learn Python The Hardway" book.

# day 7 12.01.2017
So I am closer to the end of the book. Now I will try to combine Python with HTML/CSS. I have decide to learn JavaScript, but before that I have to end with "Learn Python the Hard way" book. The ending is pretty booring, but when my Python text game will work on web, I will need to creat webpage. As I know few things from HTML and CSS, Javascript will be perfect choice for me.

# day 8 20.01.2017
I havent shown up in here because I couldnt figure out, what should i do next. So I decided to start with....website :) I will try to build my first webpage. I know little bit of HTML and CSS, so this will work for me. My new goal for my self - JavaScript. After reading some coments, i should check another language which is diffrent from Python. Most suggestions was JavaScript for Web Development. So yeah, wish me luck. Today i have created like a cover for my page (also navigation bar(found cool uderline hover code) and introduction text).


# day 9 07.11.2017
I dont know why I didnt continue with this but I am back. I am reading Jon Duckett book about a month and its been great so far. So in temp_1 folder you can find my first tamplate which I created. Today Im reading HTML5 LAYOUT (thats why I didnt use those tags in my first tamplate).

# day 10 08.11.2017
I have finished HTML/CSS chapters from this awesome book. Still struggle around flow, clear and overflow, but I will get there. I will take my final notes and then I will try to recreate easy tamplate. But at first, I need to find one....

# day 11 11.11.2017
 Fighting with third tamplate today. Trying to get more around float and everything. Few things still have to look up, but hey...you cant remeber everything.
 
# day 12 12.11.2017
I think I have figured out float (also positions). I updated tamplate with some colors, shadows, box-radiuss and I think it looks okay. I will try to add soc. icons with hovers tomorrow.

# day 13 13.11.2017
Finished my 3rd tamplate. There are some issues (hovers, fonts), but I wanted to get more around positioning and float, so I guess I know the basics of those now. Not sure what to do next, but I think I will find 4th tamplate to recreate and after that I will continue with books.

# day 13_2 13.11.2017
So I started my 4th tamplate. Finally used positions in real life and before finishing tamplates structure I realized that I need to creat individual container for left side and for right side, so every text on the right side is centered properly. Well, I will try to do that tomaroow. But in general, very productive day.
