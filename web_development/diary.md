So I finished final excercise...Im still struglle a lot. I have an idea, my ide dosent work, then I check the excercise and everything is clear to me in second and I was close to the solution, but okay, that means I need just a little bit of practice. I will continue with chapter 6 - EVENTS.

Finished 6. chaptere - events. I was trying to find a bug for a long time on last example (because some things are different in the book), but i did it. So now, I will gain my knowladge doing w3resource excercises.

# 16.01.2019 10/100
After finishing chapter 6, I am completeng tasks from w3resource page and they work great. Have to figure out how I can create click on/of event.

# 17.01.2019 11/100
Im doing tasks like this for example: Write a JavaScript function to get the value of the href, hreflang, rel, target, and type attributes of the specified link. 

# 17.01.2019 12/100
Every time, when I have to use loops, I have to think about t more but in the end I manage to create a functions which adds and removes table rows. Also, I did it with DOM functions, before I realized that there is a TABLE object in JS. Next tasks, where tables will be included I will create wit TABLE object.

# 19.01.2019 13/100
I am struggling with this one(Write a JavaScript program to remove items from a dropdown list) because JS not allows me to select selected item, but I will figure this out today!!!
Next: Write a JavaScript program to count and display the items of a dropdown list, in an alert window. 

# 20.01.2019 14/100
I did this: Write a JavaScript program to calculate the volume of a sphere
And started this one:Write a JavaScript program to display a random image (clicking on a button).
