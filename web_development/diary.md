Lets try again! Today parrent, child, first and last NodeList items

# 08.01.2019 2/100
Refreshing memory on how to add, update and remove DOM tree elements and Nodes

# 09.01.2019 3/100
Finished chapter 5. Now I know how to set, get, remove atributees (clasName, id). All I have to do to finish this chapter is to create final example. I hope I will finish ir today!

# 10.01.2019 4/100
So I finished final excercise...Im still struglle a lot. I have an idea, my ide dosent work, then I check the excercise and everything is clear to me in second and I was close to the solution, but okay, that means I need just a little bit of practice. I will continue with chapter 6 - EVENTS.

# 11.01.2019 5/100
Started working round events and event types.

# 12.01.2019 6/100
Continue working on events (what is event listeners?)

# 13.01.2019 7/100
Event flows and much more

# 14.01.2019 8/100
Different types of events, user interface events

# 15.01.2019 9/100
Finished 6. chaptere - events. I was trying to find a bug for a long time on last example (because some things are different in the book), but i did it. So now, I will gain my knowladge doing w3resource excercises.

# 16.01.2019 10/100
After finishing chapter 6, I am completeng tasks from w3resource page and they work great. Have to figure out how I can create click on/of event.

# 17.01.2019 11/100
Im doing tasks like this for example: Write a JavaScript function to get the value of the href, hreflang, rel, target, and type attributes of the specified link. 

# 17.01.2019 12/100
Every time, when I have to use loops, I have to think about t more but in the end I manage to create a functions which adds and removes table rows. Also, I did it with DOM functions, before I realized that there is a TABLE object in JS. Next tasks, where tables will be included I will create wit TABLE object.

# 19.01.2019 13/100
I am struggling with this one(Write a JavaScript program to remove items from a dropdown list) because JS not allows me to select selected item, but I will figure this out today!!!
Next: Write a JavaScript program to count and display the items of a dropdown list, in an alert window. 

# 20.01.2019 14/100
I did this: Write a JavaScript program to calculate the volume of a sphere
And started this one:Write a JavaScript program to display a random image (clicking on a button).

# 21.01.2019 15/100
I am done with w3school DOM excercises. Now I have to figure out what to do next:
1. Continue with JS excercises
2. Try to build webpage and insert JS for something (navbar, moduls or something else)
3. Start chapter 7 of Jon Ducektt book - jQuery

# 22.01.2019 16/100
I will try 2. option. Someone on Twitter suggested also the same option. So last year I was looking for job and ScandiWeb send me tasks, which I have to do to apply. PHP. As I didnt know nothing about PHP, I didnt do it. Now I decided that I will create something similar with Vanilla JS. Game review site or something like that! So far I have created objects on array and the appear on the page (for me it is amazing, as I figure out ways how to do it).

# 23.01.2019 17/100
I have created basic objects in array. Also, I rember that in one Chingu session some developers sad that better would be to use Template Strings. What the hell is that?!?! Long story, short - now Im using it (very simple to understand the concept) and Im deeling litlle bit proud of myself, just because I figure out those things by my self!

# 24.01.2019 18/100
I have to say - I am very proud of myself. I looked few things up (array.push() and valueAsNumber), but everything else I did by myself. Even found a bug, which gave me result after only second click. GREAT DAY!!!!!


# 25.01.2019 19/100
I forget how CSS styling hard was. I wanted to create cool card design but what I wanted includes SASS and tranformation and animations - all, that I havent learned at all. So I jumped to responsice CSS GRID and it works! Cards look okay, everything else looks great too! Next I wil style form (which is for adding new content to the page)!! Productive day!

# 26.01.2019 20/100
Read some blogs about CSS animations

# 27.01.2019 21/100
I created responsive form and add some styling to it. And it looks great!!! I will try to film it (how it works) and the upload on Twitter!

# 28.01.2019 22/100
I created a footer and published my training project in GitHub pages. I will post it on Twitter, maybe I get some feedback.

# 29.01.2019 23/100
TO DO LIST. ADD ITEMS - done. DELETE ITEMS - done. EDIT ITEMS - not done yet.

# 30.01.2019 24/100

# 31.01.2019 25/100
It worked yesterday visualy, but today it works how I wanted at the begining! WOOOHOOO. I know, it not much, but Im very proud of myself. TO-DO list done!

# 01.02.2019 26/100
After games covers site and to-do list (Vanilla JS), I finally decided to continue with JS&jQ book chapter 7. - jQuery!

# 02.02.2019 27/100
Watch some jQuery videos

# 03.02.2019 28/100
Read some blogs on Medium and watched few jQuery videos

# 04.02.2019 29/100
Lot of jQuery today - WORKING WITH ATTRIBUTES, CHANGING CSS RULES, USING .EACH(), EVENTS, EVENT OBJECT.

# 05.02.2019 30/100
More jQuery - DELEGATING EVENTS, BASIC EFFECTS, USING ANIMATION, TRAVERSING, FILTERS IN USE, USING INDEX NUMBERS, WORKING WITH FORMS, CUT, COPY, PASTE

# 06.02.2019 31/100
Chapter 7 jQuery - DONE. Last example was harder then I thought, but I at least finished it. Now, before moving on AJAX and JSON, I will recreate some emplates with HTML, CSS (CSS GRID for responsivnes), JS/jQuery. I have always wanted to understand how I could add scrolling efects, show/hide navigation bars, animate elements.

# 07.02.2019 32/100
Started new template. I already found new things - dark opacity on background image. Most difficult wil be position of elements which are outside other element borders , but I will try!

# 08.02.2019 33/100
I finished HTML/CSS styling (still more to go - navbar, responsivnes). But after that JS/jQuery. So far, this is the best looking thing I have crteated.

# 10.02.2019 34/100
Edit CSS responsivnes for template

# 11.02.2019 35/100
I finished responsive design for template and it looks very cool. Also I took one day off and Im not feeling good about it.

# 12.02.2019 36/100
Few edits on responsive design. Also I finally started JS/jQuery side for my project...and it is hard!

# 13.02.2019 37/100
Every time I look I found something that isnt working. Fixing responsive bugs.

# 14.02.2019 38/100
I DID IT! I figured our jQuery functions for effects. GREAT DAY!

# 15.02.2019 39/100
Template is done (some things I couldnt figure out but it looks cool). Posting that on twitter!

# 16.02.2019 40/100
AJAX/(HTML/XML/JSON) - lot of new stuff, havent done any coding, just theory reading and it sounds complicated and confusing. Cant wait to start practicing all of this with real code.

# 17.02.2019 41/100
Continue with JSON

# 18.02.2019 42/100
I struggle with stupid mistakes...but I will continue with this, because JSON and AJAX looks so usefull. Also I consider to jump back in Wes Bos JS30. My first attempt ended as I realy didnt know a thing what he was doing there.

# 19.02.2019 43/100
Cool stuff with AJAX changing content without relouding whole page. But after that examples use PHP files, so I cant recreate them. But final example dont use PHP, so I will finish reading everything and the I will recreate final example.

# 20.02.2019 44/100
Its very hard when you dont have storage files, it is very hard to complete AJAX/JSON examples. But at least I have read about it, so I know these kind of things exist. I will move to APIS now!

# 21.02.2019 45/100
I read articles and listen podcasts and all I gear how outdated lot of stuff is. So I think I will jump in Wes Bos JS30, but before that I will run threw freeCodeCamp ES6 course.

# 22.02.2019 46/100
More ES6

# 26.02.2019 47/100

# 04.03.2019 50/100
